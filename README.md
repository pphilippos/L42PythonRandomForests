## Random Forests in Python

This is my solution to a homework assigment for the course L42: Machine Learning and Algorithms for Data Mining ( https://www.cl.cam.ac.uk/teaching/1718/L42/ ), part of MPhil in Advanced Computer Science 16/17, University of Cambridge.

The PDF report provides more details. The source code includes a python implementation of Random Forests. The datasets used here (GDS5401, GDS5402, GDS5403) must be retrieved independantly.
